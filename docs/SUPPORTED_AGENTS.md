# Supported Agents

`oh-my-agent` uses `.agents/` as the project-level source of truth for skills, workflows, and shared resources.

The installer can then project compatibility to other tool-specific directories with symlinks where needed.

## Support Matrix

| Tool / IDE | Project Skill Path | Status | Interop Mode | Notes |
|------------|--------------------|--------|--------------|-------|
| Antigravity | `.agents/skills/` | First-class | Native | Primary source-of-truth layout |
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` + `.claude/agents/` | First-class | Native + Adapter | Domain skill symlinks + native workflow skills, subagents, and CLAUDE.md |
| OpenCode | `.agents/skills/` | First-class | Native-compatible | Shares the same project-level source |
| Amp | `.agents/skills/` | First-class | Native-compatible | Shares the same project-level source |
| Codex CLI | `.agents/skills/` | First-class | Native-compatible | Shares the same project-level source |
| Cursor | `.agents/skills/` | First-class | Native-compatible | Can consume the same project-level skill source |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/skills/` | Supported | Optional symlink | Created when selected during install |

## What “First-class” Means

- The installer understands the tool's expected project layout
- Skills remain authored once under `.agents/skills/`
- Interop directories are generated rather than becoming separate sources of truth
- Workflows and shared resources continue to be managed from the same project structure

## Claude Code Native Integration

Claude Code extends beyond symlinks with a full native adapter layer:

- **`CLAUDE.md`** at project root (auto-loaded by Claude Code)
- **`.claude/skills/`** — 12 workflow skills mapped from `.agents/workflows/` as native SKILL.md files
- **`.claude/agents/`** — 7 subagent definitions (backend-impl, frontend-impl, mobile-impl, db-impl, qa-reviewer, debug-investigator, pm-planner)
- **Native loop patterns** — Review Loop, Issue Remediation Loop, Phase Gate Loop via Task tool
- Domain skills remain as symlinks from `.agents/skills/` (coexist with native workflow skills)
- `.agents/` is never modified — all native files reference it as the source of truth

## Current Design Principle

`oh-my-agent` does not want one repository per IDE.

Instead:

1. author skills once under `.agents/`
2. generate compatibility views for each tool
3. keep workflows and shared resources portable
4. preserve one source of truth for versioning and maintenance
